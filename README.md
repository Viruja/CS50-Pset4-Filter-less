# Pset4-Filter-less---cs50

This is the solution for the Problem Set 04 in CS50 Harvard Uviversity.

This contains the below filters:
          - Greyscale
          - Sepia
          - Reflect
          - Blur

When testing this code the file that should be compiled is the filter.c

NOTE : when testing the test files should be BMP files.
